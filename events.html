          The newly admitted students in any Technical institution, from day one thinks about his placement on one hand and are concerned about security of one's future (jobs, livelihood etc). Due to lack of maturity of his/ her aspirations (low goals), relationship with teachers (generation gap), the students usually take short cuts (dishonesty, cheating), group conflicts in campus (leading to violence), contradictions in society, disbeliefs about technical education etc the students usually tend to go astray.
          The society, on the other hand, has lot of expectations from a graduating student. It is expected that a graduate student must have knowledge of his area of study, language skills, ability to express oneself, should know about social, economic and political systems where one lives, should have good interpersonal skills to Live and work in family and at  workplace, with harmony and possess good character. The  student Induction program hence plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap between expectation and reality. With diverse thoughts, backgrounds and preparations, it is important to help the new first year students adjust to new environment and inculcate in them the ethos of the institution with a sense of larger purpose.
          Under TEQIP – III, a massive effort was undertaken to conduct a 10 day induction programme for the newly joined 900 UG students by 25 dedicated and trained faculty, creative artists, alumni and persons of eminence. They were taught on universal human values, learn a particular art form of their choice, practices of yoga, games and public speaking.
